UCSD/CNIC Phone call 14/15 July 2014

The connection problem from UCSD to CNIC, the analysis from CNIC, the reason maybe from 2 sides:
1. the test node was deployed on virtual machine, cause the time synchronization problem.
> CNIC provide a physical host (2400:dd01:1011:1:92b1:1cff:fe0c:7c0a) for test, maybe solve the problem.
2. Temporary failure in name resolution (DNS)
> maybe resolve the name locally (add to hosts)

the throughput (ipv6) from CNIC to UCSD could have capability more than 500Mbps. The bandwidth between CNIC to the Gateway (in Tsinghua University) are 1Gbps.

CNIC and Beihang had a meeting in 7 Jul and agree on:
1. Beihang will deply the testing software integrated with rocks to build testbed.
2. Beihang and CNIC will schedule some test and maybe the first step to do experiment after Beihang finish their testbed.

UCSD provide a list of iso for deployment (http://central-x86-64.calit2.optiputer.net/isos)

CNIC will deploy the following software to testï¼š
1. CentOS-updated
2. htcondor-8.2.1
3. idpl-config
4. perfSONAR
5. + rocks == base roll, kernel roll, web-server, area51
(ipv4 ok, ipv6 need some configure)

CNIC will further check the connection problem from UCSD to CNIC

Next Skype meeting, 7pm 30 Jul/10am 31 Jul
